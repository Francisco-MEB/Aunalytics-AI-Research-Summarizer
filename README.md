# AI-Powered Professor Research Summarizer
Web application dedicated to easily-digestible summaries of complex academic papers. Without knowing all of the context and terminology that goes into a research paper, reading about what a professor really does can be a mentally exhausting task, and this project seeks to address these challenges with carefully catered prompts and fine-tuned RAG pipelines to retrieve, analyze, and summarize.
